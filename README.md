# Brexit-analysis-using-R-and-Python
Brexit Means Brexit



Used Many Algorithms with both R and Python to analyse Brexit Data and build Models on top of it, Here I have provided the whole analysis in Python notebooks and RMD

Models and Analysis Include

1)ARM
2)Clustering (Kmeans, Hierarchial, DBScan)
3)Decision Trees
4)Naive Bayes (Multinomial in Python, and  in R)
